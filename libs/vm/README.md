# Monad EVM Compiler

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is an untested work in progress.

An implementation of an [EVMC][evmc]-compatible implementation of the Ethereum
Virtual Machine, using LLVM to compile EVM bytecode to native code for faster
execution. The work in this project is a C++ reimplementation of the
[`monad-jit`][jit] project, with the eventual aim of merging the compiler into
the core Monad monorepo.

## Structure

There are four main components:
- A compiler from EVM bytecode to LLVM IR; the programs generated by this
  compiler rely on being linked against a runtime support library, and on being
  run in the context of an EVMC-compatible host.
- A runtime support library for EVM programs that handles interaction with the
  host context (gas calculations etc.).
- An EVMC-compatible VM layer that handles compiling bytecode to LLVM, then
  executing the compiled code via LLVM's JIT implementation.
- A debugging tool that compiles a contract to LLVM IR and dumps the result to
  `stdout`.
